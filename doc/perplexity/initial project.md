Answer
To set up a C++ project using fmt and Xcode to find a text (UTF-8) file with the content 'Hello World' without using STL and Boost, you will need to follow these steps. Note that avoiding STL entirely is challenging and not recommended for most C++ projects, but you can minimize its use. Here, we'll focus on using fmt for formatting and basic file operations without relying on STL containers or algorithms.
Step 1: Install fmt
First, you need to install the fmt library. You can do this using a package manager like vcpkg or by including it as a submodule in your project.
Using vcpkg:
Install vcpkg and integrate it with your project.
Install fmt using vcpkg install fmt.
As a Git Submodule:
Add fmt as a submodule to your project: git submodule add https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git.
Initialize the submodule: git submodule init.
Update the submodule: git submodule update.
Step 2: Create an Xcode Project
Create a New Project:
Open Xcode and create a new project. Choose "Command Line Tool" under the "macOS" tab.
Select "C++" as the language.
Add fmt to Your Project:
If using vcpkg, add the fmt library to your project settings.
If using a submodule, drag the fmt folder into your Xcode project navigator.
Step 3: Write the C++ Code
Create a C++ file (e.g., main.cpp) and add the following code:
cpp
#include <cstdio> // For FILE, fopen, fread, fclose
#include "fmt/core.h" // For fmt::print

int main() {
    const char* filename = "example.txt"; // File to read
    const char* targetContent = "Hello World"; // Content to find

    // Open the file
    FILE* file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (!file) {
        fmt::print("Failed to open file {}\n", filename);
        return 1;
    }

    // Read the file content
    char buffer[1024];
    size_t bytesRead = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), file);
    fclose(file);

    // Check if the file contains the target content
    bool found = false;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < bytesRead; ++i) {
        if (buffer[i] == targetContent[0]) {
            size_t j;
            for (j = 0; j < sizeof(targetContent) - 1 && i + j < bytesRead; ++j) {
                if (buffer[i + j] != targetContent[j]) break;
            }
            if (j == sizeof(targetContent) - 1) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    if (found) {
        fmt::print("File {} contains '{}'\n", filename, targetContent);
    } else {
        fmt::print("File {} does not contain '{}'\n", filename, targetContent);
    }

    return 0;
}

Step 4: Configure Xcode Project Settings
Add Include Path:
Go to your project settings, select the target, and navigate to "Build Settings".
Find "Header Search Paths" and add the path to the fmt include directory.
Link Against fmt:
If using vcpkg, ensure that the fmt library is linked against your project.
If using a submodule, add the fmt library to the "Link Binary with Libraries" section under "Build Phases".
Step 5: Build and Run
Build your project using Xcode.
Run the project. It should print whether the file example.txt contains 'Hello World'.
Note
This example minimizes the use of STL but does not eliminate it entirely since fmt itself uses some STL components internally. For practical purposes, using STL is recommended for most C++ projects due to its efficiency and standardization.
